Relay
=====

Relay is a library of classes and methods that are commonly used in Java programs but are not provided by the language by default. For example, if you wanted to apply an RGB filter to a picture or wanted or to mark the edges of an image, you would have to loop through all of the pixels and change the color of each pixel yourself. With Relay, functions like these are only a call away.

Currently, Relay contains packages for:
* Image Tools,
* Array Tools,
* and Math Tools 

This list will expand as the project goes on. 

If you have a suggestion or request for a feature, contact sjbhalli@gmail.com or fork the repository and contribute to the project. Any amount of help is greatly appreciated.
